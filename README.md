# Marketplace-price-prediction
At a large scale, determining product pricing becomes increasingly challenging due to the vast number of products sold online. Different product categories, such as clothing and electronics, exhibit unique pricing trends. Clothing prices are heavily influenced by seasonal trends and brand names, while electronics prices fluctuate based on product specifications.

Mercari, Japan's largest community-powered shopping app, is well aware of this complexity. They aim to provide pricing suggestions to sellers on their marketplace. However, this task is difficult as Mercari's sellers have the freedom to list almost anything or any combination of items, making it a complex and diverse marketplace.

GOAL OF THIS PROJECT: Use Regression models to predict reasonable Selling Prices based on features of categories on Mercari, an online marketplace
